## About PinFactory
​
When Adam Smith wrote [*The Wealth of Nations*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Nations), in 1776, he described the immense increase of production—and the superior perfection of products—from a [division of labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_labour). He illustrated this concept with [a pin factory](https://www.adamsmithworks.org/pin_factory.html), demonstrating a hyper-specialization of labor as the dynamic engine of economic progress.

As front-end web technology evolves, the industry's full-stack model is unable to keep up with the increasingly complex nuances of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. At PinFactory, we believe that specialization is a long-tested solution to improving user experiences, performance, accessibility and production, at scale.

PinFactory has no full-time staff. We are a team of specialized UX talent, available to augment your existing staff. Perhaps you have a designer whose talents would be unproductive at engineering a complex responsive layout in Sass. Or, say you have exceptional engineers that code performant and highly-scalable web apps but simply don't have the bandwidth to nudge pixels to specifications or do not possess intricate accessibility knowledge. Similarly, we can match you with highly-specialized designers and engineers who work best within this model.

When you incorporate PinFactory's model into your team, your engineers become more focused, your designers become better designers and your business reaches its full potential.

*If you're looking for talented UX specialists to run or augment your project, get in touch once we're up and running! Stay tuned.*
